# AI-Driven-Financial-Analysis-Tool
We have a partner at an accounting firm who a lot of industry knowledge and we would like to absorb his knowledge when he analyzes financials. how can we capture that information and then have a tool to upload the financials and have it analyzed?
-------------
To capture the expertise of the partner at the accounting firm and leverage it to analyze financials through an AI tool, we can design a system that includes knowledge extraction, machine learning model training, and an AI-driven financial analysis tool. Below is an outline and Python code to help you get started with this process:
Step-by-Step Plan:

    Knowledge Capture:
        Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to capture and structure the accounting partner’s insights.
        Convert the partner’s knowledge into a structured format like FAQs, guidelines, or even financial rules that the AI can refer to.

    Document Upload & Parsing:
        Upload financial documents (e.g., balance sheets, income statements).
        Parse these documents into a structured format like JSON, CSV, or a database.

    Analysis Model:
        Use machine learning models to analyze the financials based on the captured knowledge.
        The model can look for anomalies, trends, and insights using the partner’s expertise to make informed recommendations.

    User Interface:
        Build a user-friendly interface to upload financials and retrieve analysis results.

Step 1: Capture Knowledge

We’ll start by structuring the knowledge from the partner. This can be done by capturing insights from conversations, documents, or FAQs and converting them into rules or insights.
Example:

Assume the partner provides a few rules and insights like:

    “If the current ratio is below 1, the company might have liquidity problems.”
    “A debt-to-equity ratio above 2 indicates high leverage.”

We’ll store this knowledge in a structured way (e.g., a dictionary).

# Knowledge base in a structured form
financial_rules = {
    "current_ratio": {
        "threshold": 1,
        "advice": "If the current ratio is below 1, the company might have liquidity problems."
    },
    "debt_to_equity": {
        "threshold": 2,
        "advice": "A debt-to-equity ratio above 2 indicates high leverage."
    }
}

# Function to check financial ratios and provide advice
def analyze_financial_ratios(financial_data):
    advice = []
    
    # Current Ratio Analysis
    current_ratio = financial_data.get("current_assets", 0) / financial_data.get("current_liabilities", 1)
    if current_ratio < financial_rules["current_ratio"]["threshold"]:
        advice.append(financial_rules["current_ratio"]["advice"])
    
    # Debt to Equity Ratio Analysis
    debt_to_equity = financial_data.get("total_debt", 0) / financial_data.get("total_equity", 1)
    if debt_to_equity > financial_rules["debt_to_equity"]["threshold"]:
        advice.append(financial_rules["debt_to_equity"]["advice"])
    
    return advice

Step 2: Upload Financials and Parse Data

Now, you need to upload financial documents (e.g., PDFs or Excel files) and parse them. You can use Python libraries like PyPDF2 or pandas to handle various document formats.
Example Code for Parsing PDF (financial statement):

import PyPDF2

# Function to extract text from PDF
def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path):
    with open(pdf_path, "rb") as file:
        reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(file)
        text = ""
        for page in reader.pages:
            text += page.extract_text()
        return text

# Example: extract financial information from the extracted text
def extract_financial_data(text):
    financial_data = {}
    
    # Sample logic for extracting key values (customize based on text format)
    lines = text.split("\n")
    for line in lines:
        if "current assets" in line.lower():
            financial_data["current_assets"] = float(line.split(":")[1].strip())
        elif "current liabilities" in line.lower():
            financial_data["current_liabilities"] = float(line.split(":")[1].strip())
        elif "total debt" in line.lower():
            financial_data["total_debt"] = float(line.split(":")[1].strip())
        elif "total equity" in line.lower():
            financial_data["total_equity"] = float(line.split(":")[1].strip())
    
    return financial_data

Step 3: AI Analysis and Insights

Once the financial data is extracted, we can apply the rules-based system to generate analysis and insights.
Example: Applying the Knowledge to the Extracted Data:

# Example: Financial data extracted from the PDF
pdf_text = extract_text_from_pdf("financial_statement.pdf")
financial_data = extract_financial_data(pdf_text)

# Analyze the financial data using captured knowledge
advice = analyze_financial_ratios(financial_data)
print("Financial Advice: ", advice)

Step 4: Deploying and Automating Analysis

For a scalable and user-friendly system, you can integrate the entire process into a web application using Flask (or any other web framework) to handle file uploads and interact with the backend analysis.
Flask Example (for file upload and analysis):

from flask import Flask, request, render_template
import os

app = Flask(__name__)

# Function to save uploaded file
def save_file(file):
    file_path = os.path.join("uploads", file.filename)
    file.save(file_path)
    return file_path

@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def home():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        uploaded_file = request.files['file']
        if uploaded_file.filename.endswith('.pdf'):
            file_path = save_file(uploaded_file)
            # Extract financial data and analyze
            pdf_text = extract_text_from_pdf(file_path)
            financial_data = extract_financial_data(pdf_text)
            advice = analyze_financial_ratios(financial_data)
            return render_template('result.html', advice=advice)
    return render_template('index.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

HTML Template (index.html):

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Financial Analysis Tool</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Upload Financial Statement</h1>
    <form action="/" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
        <input type="file" name="file" required>
        <button type="submit">Upload</button>
    </form>
</body>
</html>

Step 5: Advanced Enhancements (Optional)

    Machine Learning: You can train a model using historical financial data and partner insights. A model could help predict financial health or suggest specific actions.
    Automated Insights: The system could automatically generate insights beyond rule-based logic, based on patterns observed in the data.

Conclusion

By capturing the partner’s expertise and combining it with AI, you can create a system that not only parses financial documents but also analyzes them against industry knowledge, providing actionable insights. The AI tool can be expanded with machine learning models for deeper analysis and predictions, ensuring it is scalable and adaptable as more data becomes available.
